## 5. Rate Limiting and Server Respect

In no event shall the author be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages arising from your use of this software, including but not limited to loss of data, violation of third-party terms of service, or legal claims arising from scraping activities you conduct.

**You use this software at your own risk.**
